# Enviroschool Game
---
This game was created in the TED31 class.
It was created for an assessment which required us to build a game to teach about plastics in our oceans.

To run the code:
- Download the repo (or clone it)
- unzip it (if downloaded)
- open the index.html file in Chrome
- Have fun

Feel free to mess with and edit the game as much as you want. It's a school project, not the Mona Lisa.
